# Project: Monty Bytecode Interpreter

## Description

This project involves creating a bytecode interpreter for Monty, a simple language that is first compiled into Monty bytecode. The interpreter can execute various stack and queue operations, utilizing data structures such as stacks (LIFO) and queues (FIFO). It also includes implementations for arithmetic operations and Brainfuck scripts.

- Code must follow the Betty style.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The standard library is allowed.

## Tasks

### Task 0: push, pall

Implement the push and pall opcodes.

### Task 1: pint

Implement the pint opcode to print the top of the stack.

### Task 2: pop

Implement the pop opcode to remove the top element of the stack.

### Task 3: swap

Implement the swap opcode to swap the top two elements of the stack.

### Task 4: add

Implement the add opcode to add the top two elements of the stack.

### Task 5: nop

Implement the nop opcode, which does nothing.

### Task 6: sub

Implement the sub opcode to subtract the top element from the second top element.

### Task 7: div

Implement the div opcode to divide the second top element by the top element.

### Task 8: mul

Implement the mul opcode to multiply the top two elements of the stack.

### Task 9: mod

Implement the mod opcode to compute the remainder of dividing the second top element by the top element.

### Task 10: comments

Handle comment lines (starting with #) by ignoring them.

### Task 11: pchar

Implement the pchar opcode to print the char corresponding to the top value of the stack.

### Task 12: pstr

Implement the pstr opcode to print a string starting from the top of the stack.

### Task 13: rotl

Implement the rotl opcode to rotate the stack to the top.

### Task 14: rotr

Implement the rotr opcode to rotate the stack to the bottom.

### Task 15: stack, queue

Implement stack and queue opcodes to switch between LIFO and FIFO.

### Task 16: Brainf*ck

Write a Brainf*ck script that prints "School".

### Task 17: Add two digits

Write a Brainf*ck script that reads two digits, adds them, and prints the result.

### Task 18: Multiplication

Write a Brainf*ck script that reads two digits, multiplies them, and prints the result.

### Task 19: Multiplication level up

Write a Brainf*ck script that reads two digits, multiplies them, and prints the result, followed by a newline.
